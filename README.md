# Data-Structures-Algorithms-for-beginners


## Welcome note:

Welcome to this repository, as we step into the Hacktober month, its time to either learn or renew what we learned by contributing to the learning community.We can all remember some specific article being helpful in understanding a concept easier. And thats exactly what I am hoping to get from this repository.This is an open source repo, so all contributions are welcome.

## What this repo is about:

A data structure is a group of data elements, that can be used to organise and store data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.
Data Structure and algorithms provide an efficient way to have a good sofware design. Developing and deploying good algorithms is a needed skill for any programmmer.
So in this repository the procedure to correctly implement any data structures is provided briefly.

## How to contribute?

If you know a better way to implement an algorithm or if you wish to make some additions/changes to the code in the repository, you can contribute.

* Make sure the your issue is not mentioned before, and then file a new issue explaining the changes you have in your mind.

* Ensure your code/algorithm is unique, to avoid making duplicate algorithms

* Test your code/algorithm thoroughly and add some test cases and their results.

* Add the file to the corresponding folder in the repository, if needed you can create a new folder.

## Rules for Contribution:

Content such as spam, promotion or irrelevant posts are not tolerated.

* Language Restriction - C and C++ (Both struct and class implementations of DS is preferable)

* Plagiarism by any means, will not be tolerated.

* Verbal abuse or hate speech is strongly prohibited.

* Make sure your code is understandable and explained with comments.
